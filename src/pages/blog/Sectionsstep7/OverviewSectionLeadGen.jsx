<p>Regardless of if you run a small freelance consulting firm or you work for McKinsey, lead generation is a critical function of growing the business.</p>
<p>The volume of leads of each consulting firm will vary greatly depending on your niche and the power of your brand in a given niche. At <a href="http://strategically.co/">Strategically</a> we focus on creating and promoting high-quality leads. </p>
<p>Even for specific niche services and well-known brands in these sectors, firms will still require a significant number of leads to achieve a single signed contract. This is the nature of sales. </p>
<p>The quality of the leads you generate will also vary greatly depending on the lead source and the tactics used to generate marketing-qualified leads. </p>
<p>In our opinion, the highest quality leads are from customers outwardly searching for your services. Generally, these leads are acquired by either organic or paid traffic. </p>
<p>However, the total volume of this type of lead available in highly specialised consulting niches can be very limited, so additional lead volume must be acquired to support the sale efforts. </p>
<p>In this article we are going to discuss some of the tactics that can be used to generate leads in the consulting niche. </p>
<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Find Customers Looking for Services With Pay Per Click</h2>
<p>Almost certainly, paid Google adverts should be part of the lead generation strategy for a consulting firm. For consulting lead generation Google Ads campaigns, we almost always opt for a campaign structure known as a SKAG (Single Keyword Advert Group) campaign to maximise the potential click-through rate and outperform standard PPC campaigns.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Create Service Landing Pages to Capture Organic Search</h2>
<p>Traffic quality matters. Most consulting firms work in small niches where the traffic volume is limited. The highest quality traffic available are users searching directly for consulting services. We often recommend listing the core areas of expertise in the main navigation and then creating a mega navigation to allow users to drill down into the specific services on offer. Creating a single landing page tailored to each microservice you offer helps the website rank for long-tail keywords and helps potential clients understand the company's areas of expertise.</p>
<img style={{ width: `100%`,}}
                   src="/assets/images/Lead_generation_for_consulting_companies1.jpg" alt="lead generation for consulting companies"></img>
<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Create More Valuable Blog Content</h2>
<p>The importance of creating regular high-quality content cannot be underestimated. Pay close attention to what people are searching for and create content that your customers will find valuable. Most firms should be creating between four and eight new items of high-quality content per month.</p>

                   src="/assets/images/Lead_gen_for_consulting_companies.jpg" alt="lead generation for consulting companies"></img>
<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Create More Downloadable Content</h2>
<p>Creating a knowledge hub is a must when looking to generate consulting leads. When creating this resource you should consider creating a diverse selection of downloadable guides, as the diversity will increase the chances of your content aligning with the needs of your potential clients. The greater the alignment between the audience's needs and the resources, the greater the chance the users will download your content.&nbsp;Creating downloadable resources helps to generate potential consulting clients early in the sales cycle as the prospects are generally looking for information around the subject months prior to searching for a vendor. The earlier your sales team can connect with prospects, the more time you have to build the relationship with the prospects.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Build an Audience Using Social Media Groups</h2>
<p>Creating a LinkedIn or Facebook group helps you build an audience that your company can constantly market to. These groups allow consulting firms to guide the conversation and it also creates a valuable outlet for your content.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Put Lead Generation on Autopilot with an Automated Webinar</h2>
<p>Webinars and podcasts are booming right now. Creating a webinar or academy course can be an excellent way of driving a high volume of marketing-qualified leads. Creating a training course which shows your knowledge around the subject matter without selling your services can help your team to build a relationship with the customer and allow you to be the trusted expert on a specific subject. Webinars are also a great way to introduce yourself to the audience without the need to attend a one-to-one meeting.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Create an Online Demo that Takes the Pressure Off Your Sales Team</h2>
<p>If you are selling software as part of your consulting service, then an online demo locked behind a lead form can be a great way to connect with people who want to know more about your services but who are not quite ready to speak with the sales team. This group of potential customers can be sizeable, and with a good CRM follow-up process, the rewards can be significant.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Try Tender Portals</h2>
<p>Find out which portals are applicable for your niche and ensure that you are submitting tenders. For smaller consulting firms this could be looking at online freelance websites such as Upwork, while for large consulting companies you might be tendering for national government contracts on large specialised tender platforms.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Outbound Sales</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether your consulting company is large or small, outbound prospecting should have a place in your lead generation efforts. Outbound is controllable; the more energy put in, the more contracts will be won. This is a great tactic for small firms looking to scale with limited funds.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Use Adroll, Facebook or LinkedIn Retargeting to Drive Returning Visitors</h2>
<p>Creating custom audiences and promoting content and adverts at your custom audiences can be a very effective tactic to assist your conversions. It is very rare that a user will convert on their first visit to the website, so help your customers remember your brand after the initial touch by using adverts and promoted content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Create More Case Studies</h2>
<p>Creating quality case studies always helps. Always remember to tie your case studies back to revenue. This is a great example from salesprocess.io showing net cash flow by the source after they started working with a firm. What better way to prove the value that your services add?</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Create a Glossary Of Terms Which Relate to Your Niche</h2>
<p>Creating a glossary of terms might seem like a waste of energy; however, this simple tactic can generate a lot of quality links which will help your content rank. The key to building a glossary that works is to create a single page per term using the following URL structure: www.example.com/glossary/glossary-term/. This ensures that every glossary term page is highly specific for the search query.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>When You Are Selling Knowledge, Your People Matter</h2>
<p>Consulting is all about selling knowledge. Your people are your greatest asset and the website should showcase your people front and centre. Make sure you link back from your email footer to your LinkedIn and profile page to help potential clients reach out to you when you send emails.</p>

<h2 style={{ fontSize: "40px",}}>Make Sure You Set Up Analytics Correctly</h2>
<p>Understanding Google Analytics data can make the difference between success and failure. Analytics should be part of your weekly or monthly lead generation process. Use cohort analysis to evaluate the performance of your company's lead generation performance week over week.</p>
