             <h6>Itâ€™s easy for a design-driven company like ours to quickly adapt new methodologies and refine problem-solving skills through iteration, trial, and error. For Roche, a $30 billion dollar pharmaceutical giant with over 80,000 employees worldwide, change is a bit slower.</h6>
             <h6>The Roche Global Market Insights team spent nearly two weeks in our office in San Diego (in addition to months of consultation) as we provided hands-on training through a series of workshops, ending with a real-world five day Design Sprint. The goal: to empower the Roche team so they could return to their organization with design-thinking methodologies that could transform the way their teams solve problems.</h6>
